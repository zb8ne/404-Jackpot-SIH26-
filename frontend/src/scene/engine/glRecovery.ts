/**
 * Surviving a lost WebGL context.
 *
 * Chromium caps how many WebGL contexts one renderer process may hold (~16) and,
 * when a new one pushes past the cap, it EVICTS THE OLDEST — logging only
 * "WARNING: Too many active WebGL contexts. Oldest context will be lost."
 *
 * The office floor's context is created at app startup, so it is always the
 * oldest one alive. Every terminal xterm opens takes another context
 * (@xterm/addon-webgl), so on a busy floor — enough agents, or a second window —
 * the office is the first thing evicted. Pixi does not notice: no exception, no
 * rejected promise, no failure banner. The canvas simply stops drawing and the
 * office goes blank until the app is restarted. That is the blank-office bug.
 *
 * xterm already handles this by falling back to its DOM renderer. Pixi has no
 * such fallback, so the scene has to be rebuilt instead. This module is only the
 * event wiring, kept separate from OfficeFloor so the recovery policy — cancel
 * the event, debounce, cap the retries, give up loudly — is testable against a
 * plain EventTarget with no browser, no GPU and no Pixi.
